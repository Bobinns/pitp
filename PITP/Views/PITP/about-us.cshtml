                <p>Party In the Park is an event organised by various community groups in the area around Fordham Park. It’s a community event for all ages, with family events, arts and crafts, stalls, spoken word, as well as local bands and acts for all tastes from disco to reggae, punk rock, soul and folk.</p>
                <p>In both @Html.ActionLink("2013", "pastevents", "pitp", null, null,"2013", null, null) and <a href = '@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")' >2014</a> the event provided a large range of food stalls, a New Cross Inn beer tent. 
                   <a href="http://www.madcapcoalition.org.uk/">MADCAP </a> entertained - providing games and competitions with lots of prizes. The festival last year had a health and well being "Detox city" area, stalls that promoted the work of community projects such as, <a href="http://www.buildthelenox.org/">The Lenox Project" Grow Wild</a>, and the great work that housing co-operatives do.</p>
                <p>Local press coverage heralded both the events held in 2013 and 2014 as hugely successful. As part of the build up to this year’s festival we will be heavily promoting the event.

                <p>A number of different community groups and local businesses collaborate to make Party In The Park happen. 
                    Last year we had a dedicated number of people directly involved with the events organisation. Planning for the party occurred over the course of a year and involved a number of fund raisers. These events were successful in raising money for and promoting Party In The Park.</p>

                <p>We partcularly had a lot of help from two organisations - New Cross Learning, and MadCap Coalition.
                    We also were able to deliver great live music from Siren Sound and Reknaw and had some great DJ's such as Softwax.
                </p>

                <p>We managed to gain the support and financial sposorship from the following orgainiastions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Birds Nest</li>
                    <li>New Cross Inn</li>
                    <li>Three Boroughs Housing Co-operative</li>
                    <li>Hexagon Housing Association</li>
