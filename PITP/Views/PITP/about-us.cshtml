                    Back for 2018, Party in the Park is a free festival providing music and entertainment for the New Cross and Deptford communities.
                    Providing a free summer festival this years event will showcase a large number of brilliant and diverse local performances.
                    Party in the Park is a local event for all ages.</p>
                <p>
                    Drawing upon the <a href='@Url.Action("tentcity", "PITP")'>Tent City</a> event hosted back in 2016, the theme and focus of this years event will focus on housing for the community.
                 With a special health and well being area, arts and crafts stalls and family entertainment this years festival will cater for everyone that attends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To date the event has been made possible as a result of the collaboration of a number of different community organisations, groups, and business.
                    Celebrating the rich cultural diversity and identity of the area Party in the Park is a great day out for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September the 1st Fordham Park will host the festival and provide a platform for a number of groups that work within the Deptford and New Cross area.
                    Building on the successes of past festivals held in <a href='@Url.Action("year2013", "PITP")'>2013</a>, <a href='@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")'>2014</a>, and <a href='@Url.Action("year2016", "PITP")'>2016</a> we hope to provide Party in the Park's best festival to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The festival is run by a number of dedicated volunteers that give their free time to organise the event.
                    However, Party in the Park is only possible as a result of the financial contributions from you the community.</p>
                <p>
                    Please contribute to our crowdfund campaign - all donations are greatly appreciated.

                <p>With your help we can ensure that Party in the Park in 2018 will be our best party yet!</p> 
                <p>Party In the Park is an event organised by various community groups in the area around Fordham Park. The festival's 
                <a href="@Url.Action("origins", "PITP")">origins</a> can be traced back to the Deptford Urban Free Festival. Party in the Park is a community event 
                for all ages, with family events, arts and crafts, stalls, spoken word, as well as local bands and acts for all tastes from disco to reggae, punk rock, 
                soul and folk.</p>
                <p>In both <a href='@Url.Action("year2013", "PITP")'>2013</a> and <a href='@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")'>2014</a> the
    event provided a large range of food stalls, a New Cross Inn beer tent.
    <a href="http://www.madcapcoalition.org.uk/">MADCAP </a> entertained - providing games and competitions with lots of prizes.
    The festival in 2014 had a health and well being "Detox city" area, and stalls that promoted the work of community projects such as,
    <a href="http://www.buildthelenox.org/">The Lenox Project" Grow Wild</a>, and stalls that promoted the great work that housing co-operatives do.
</p>
                <p>Local press coverage heralded both the events held in 2013 and 2014 as hugely successful.

                    A number of different community groups and local businesses collaborate to make Party In The Park happen. To date we have had a dedicated 
                    number of people directly involved with the events organisation. Planning for past festivals has involved a number of fund raisers. 
                    These events were successful in raising money for and promoting Party In The Park.
                </p> 
                <p>
                In the run up to this years event - we are hosting a number of benefit events and gigs. These up and coming events are 
                vital for the funding and promotion of Party in the Park. Check out our "<a href='@Url.Action("Upandcoming", "PITP")'>
                Up and Coming</a>" events page, or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PitpInthepark/" alt="pitp facebook link">

                Twitter</a> to get up to date details.</p>

                <p>We particularly have had a lot of help from two organisations - New Cross Learning, and MadCap Coalition. Great live music has been provided by 
                Siren Sound and Reknaw, and we have had some great DJ's, such as Softwax.</p>
