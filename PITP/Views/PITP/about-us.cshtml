                <p>Party In the Park is an event organised by various community groups in the area around Fordham Park. The festival's 
                <a href="@Url.Action("origins", "PITP")">origins</a> can be traced back to the Deptford Urban Free Festival. Party in the Park is a community event 
                for all ages, with family events, arts and crafts, stalls, spoken word, as well as local bands and acts for all tastes from disco to reggae, punk rock, 
                soul and folk.</p>
                <p>In both @Html.ActionLink("2013", "pastevents", "pitp", null, null,"2013", null, null) and <a href = '@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")' >2014</a> the 
                event provided a large range of food stalls, a New Cross Inn beer tent. 
                   <a href="http://www.madcapcoalition.org.uk/">MADCAP </a> entertained - providing games and competitions with lots of prizes. 
                The festival in 2014 had a health and well being "Detox city" area, and stalls that promoted the work of community projects such as, 
                <a href="http://www.buildthelenox.org/">The Lenox Project" Grow Wild</a>, and stalls that promoted the great work that housing co-operatives do.</p>
                <p>Local press coverage heralded both the events held in 2013 and 2014 as hugely successful. 
                As part of the build up to this year’s festival we will be heavily promoting the event.

                    A number of different community groups and local businesses collaborate to make Party In The Park happen. To date we have had a dedicated 
                    number of people directly involved with the events organisation. Planning for past festivals has involved a number of fund raisers. 
                    These events were successful in raising money for and promoting Party In The Park.
                </p> 
                <p>
                In the run up to this years event - planned for the summer of 2016 - we will be holding a number of benefit events and gigs. These up and coming events are 
                vital for the financing of this summer's festival. Check out our "<a href='@Url.Action("Upandcoming", "PITP")'>
                Up and Coming</a>" events page, or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005402296847" alt="pitp facebook link">

                <p>We particularly have had a lot of help from two organisations - New Cross Learning, and MadCap Coalition. Great live music has been provided by 
                Siren Sound and Reknaw, and we have had some great DJ's, such as Softwax.</p>

                <p>Over the past few years we have managed to gain the support and financial sponsorship from the following organisations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Birds Nest</li>
                    <li>New Cross Inn</li>
