                <p>London is experiencing an ongoing housing crisis. At this year’s Party in the Park 2018, “Tent City” will look at the housing problems our communities face.</p>
                
                <p>We hope to bring together a number of different people to look at ways that the attack on social housing can be challenged. “Tent City” will look at how we can organise to combat the social cleansing of our neighbourhoods and campaign for better social housing provision.</p>
                
                <p>We will also look at what can be achieved via tenant empowerment, and examine a number of innovative approaches to the development of social housing. Focusing on the benefits of collaboration we will provide a platform to groups that wish to ensure regeneration doesn’t compromise neighbourhood integrity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The itinerary of the event will consist of two panel discussions interspersed by a number of workshops. Throughout the day we also have a number of additional activities that will run concurrently with the main schedule. Festival goers will be encouraged to participate in the Tent City site décor, or the “Landlords in stocks” feature. With a number of spoken word/ acoustic entertainers, and a superb children’s puppet show, “Judy needs a House” we hope to provide something for everyone.
