            <p>To all you people out there looking forward to Party-in-the-ParkNXD. Disappointing news I'm afraid! It is with reluctance, regret and a heavy heart that in the long term best interests of the festival it was unanimously decided - after an emergency meeting held on Tuesday 4th August, to cancel this years' Festival. We will be back for 2016!</p>

                <h3 style="text-align:center">We will be back in 2016...</h3>
                <p>Due to timescales and a hitch in the process of applying for a premises licence, Party in the Park has been cancelled for 2015.                 
                As we do not have enough time to comply with the conditions and deadlines of a premises licence, it was decided not to risk jeopardising the long term future of the festival - better to consolidate and deliver a well organised, better prepared festival next year. </p>
                <p>Party in the Park in Deptford, is a great free festival providing music and entertainment for the New Cross and Deptford communities - with a large number of brilliant diverse performers. <br />If you wish to help us organise the festival in 2016, please <a href='@Url.Action("contact", "PITP")' >get in touch</a></p>
                <p>After the success of last year’s “Party in the Park <a href='@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")'>2014</a>”, the event’s organisers are planning an even bigger and better day out for 2016! Find out more <a href='@Url.Action("about-us", "PITP")' >about</a> us or check out our <a href="/sponsors#sponsor">sponsorship</a> opportunities</p>

                <h3>Past Events</h3>
                @*<p>The Party, organised by a number of community groups that include New Cross Learning and Madcap Coalition, is a revival of the famous <a href="http://transpont.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/urban-free-festival-1992.html">Urban Free Festival</a>. Party in the Park is a New Cross/Deptford community event for all ages, with family events, arts and crafts, stalls, spoken word, as well as local bands and acts for all tastes from disco to reggae, punk rock, soul and folk.</p>*@
                <p><a href='@Url.Action("year2014", "PITP")' >In 2014</a> Party in the Park held a very successful event in Fordham Park, Deptford. Blessed by good weather, the festival provided a great day out for all who attended. The event’s organisers first came together to help deliver the festival in @Html.ActionLink("2013", "pastevents", "pitp", null, null,"2013", null, null) and building upon this, worked together again to deliver an even bigger and better event.</p>

                <p>In order to help pay for Party in the Park a number of fund raisers have been successfully held in the past. We intend to put on more <a href='@Url.Action("Upandcoming", "PITP")'>Up and Comming Events page</a> in order to help pay for the fesival this summer.</p>
